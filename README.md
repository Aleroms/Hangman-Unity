# HANGMAN-UNITY
This project is related to [Hangman Console](https://github.com/aleroms/hangman-console). I made that project following SOLID principal, thinking it will be easy to port from Console to using Unity game engine.

This project focuses on applying my [AWS Solution's Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/3469ef9c-aaf1-4cb6-b881-0f20d71af353) knowledge and integrating AWS Bedrock, API Gateway and Lambda in order t make the classic Hangman game but uses Generative AI to generate the guess word. Currently, I found that Anthropotic Claude 1 Instant suits this game more than Meta Llama 3 (which I originally used).
